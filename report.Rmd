## Data and priors

First thing I'm going to do is read in and process the data. These species names look weird, maybe a parsing error? Is this from the FAO or a local dataset? THe FishStat database usually has genus and species for some species even for regions like this.

I've placed the data in a folder aclled data inside the repository I'm using to develop this.

We now have a "tidy" and longer-format datadrame that is much more condusive to analysis. For example, let's plot some things:

![Figure: Catch by stock.](data/catch_by_stock.png)

![Figure: Total catch.](data/catch_total.png)

I'm also going to do a bit of data filtering here, for stocks that have at least 20 years of 0 catches.

Going to change this a bit to filter early years without catches, making sure we get the species name read in corectly especially if we have 2 oceans with similar caught species (GOT and AND).

```{r}
input <- readRDS("data/input.rds")
knitr::kable(input$data[[2]], caption="Catch and effort data for *Sardinella aurita*.")
```

## Analysis

We use the `purrr` package here, along with `tibbles` to organize the results. This is a form of functional programming, where the goal is to write processes as functions and apply over data.

First, make a nested data frame and then create a driors object for each stock, to ckeck LHP are read correctly.

Now that we have our driors, we'll use them to fit our models, only using 10 for now for speeds sake, comment line 170 out for the full set.

We can then include summaries of our results... Note, from Marcelo, need to check if model works better with randome effects on r; Red Mullet issues; jumps in catches we should run before running model (add criteria for filterimg data).

And filter out any runs with gradients above 1e-3.
